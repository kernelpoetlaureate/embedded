# Secure Bootloader FOTA Project

This project implements a Secure Bootloader with Firmware Over-The-Air (FOTA) update capability for advanced embedded systems.

## Structure
- `bootloader/` - Secure bootloader source code
- `fota/` - FOTA update logic

## Key Features
- Secure boot with firmware verification
- Over-the-air firmware update support
- Rollback and recovery mechanisms
- Cryptographic verification (to be implemented)

## Getting Started
1. Implement hardware-specific functions in `bootloader/` and `fota/`.
2. Integrate cryptographic libraries for secure verification.
3. Add network stack for FOTA (e.g., HTTP, MQTT).
4. Build and flash the bootloader to your target device.

## Next Steps
- Fill in TODOs in source files for your platform.
- Add unit tests and hardware integration tests.
- Document update process and security model.
